# Geospatial Data Analysis with Python
Course material from the Winter 2020 offering at the University of Washington

## Overview
This course explores advanced geospatial data processing, analysis/interpretation, and visualization techniques using Python, shell scripting, and open-source tools/libraries (GDAL, NumPy, Pandas and derivatives like geopandas and xarray). We will explore fundamental concepts and real-world data science applications involving large geospatial datasets.

## Syllabus

## Structure
Mixed graduate and upper-level undergraduate course:
* One 3-hour lab session per week for 10-week quarter
* Students complete online reading assignments prior to lab
* Each lab begins with 0.5-1.0 hour interactive discussion/demo
* Students then continue independently attempt exercises in a Jupyter notebook in small groups, and finish for homework (due the following week)
* Students report ~6-12 hours outside of lab required to complete reading and homework

## Reproducing the GDA Course environment
[Insert Binder badge]  
Clicking this button will launch the GDA image on AWS us-west-2 using a pangeo binder. This will provide the same environment that was available on the course Jupyterhub during winter 2020. However, the session is ephemeral and your home directory will not persist, so use this only for running tutorials and other short-lived demos!

### Reproducing locally
See the [Week 10 materials](./modules/10_Conda_Pangeo_Dask).
Conda environment files:
* [uwgda2020](https://github.com/UW-GDA/uwgda-image/blob/master/binder/environment.yml) (pinned version numbers)
* [uwgda2020_latest](https://github.com/UW-GDA/uwgda-image/blob/master/binder/environment_latest.yml) (includes latest features/bugfixes, untested with course material)

## Note for instructors
I've attempted to compile resources for others who are or will be teaching similar material (or using similar resources).
If you find it useful, please 

## Contributions
If you find errors or make some improvements, please consider creating a Github Issue or submitting a Pull Request. I view this as an open, collaborative effort. I expect to teach this course in the coming years, and will continue refining the material, so I appreciate all of the help I can get.

## Acknowledgements
Many individuals have contributed to the content development and infrastructure required for this course:
* First and foremost, the brave GDA students who enrolled in this course duing winter 2019 and winter 2020 provided critical feedback, suggestions and often elegant solutions to challenging problems
* Chris Land (UW-IT) and Scott Henderson (UW eScience/ESS) provided Jupyterhub configuration and support during 2020
* Amanda Tan (UW eScience) provided Jupyterhub configuration and support during 2019
* Bill Schaefer (UW-IT) and Rob Fatland (UW-IT/eScience) provided spport and management during 2020 and 2019, respectively
* Friedrich Knuth provided material on conda and support
* Anthony Arendt and the UW eScience Geohackweek leadership team for providing a foundation and resources for interactive education and software development
