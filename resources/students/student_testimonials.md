# Testimonials
Several past GDA students have shared some kind words about their experience in the class, and how it has helped with their research and career. I wanted to document some of these here. They are useful for me to revisit when I'm having a rough day and/or need a little extra motivation.

*"Just a quick note to say hi and an anecdote. Today I rewrote an existing python script at work that previously took about 1 hour to run for a given input. It was manipulating a text file with for loops etc. By using what I learned about Pandas vectorization vs loops I was able to cut the runtime down to less than 30 seconds. That is what I call value added. Thank you!  
I have also since made quite good use of Pandas for a few other scripts dealing with hydrology-related timeseries and canâ€™t imagine not having taken the course and having to fumble my way through learning it piecemeal. Thank you again for delivering high value, real-world skills content in an inclusive, innovative learning environment."*
