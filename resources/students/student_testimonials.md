# Testimonials
Several past GDA students have shared some kind words about their experience in the class, and how it has helped with their research and career. I wanted to document some of these here. They are useful for me to revisit when I'm having a rough day and/or need a little extra motivation.

*"Just a quick note to say hi and an anecdote. Today I rewrote an existing python script at work that previously took about 1 hour to run for a given input. It was manipulating a text file with for loops etc. By using what I learned about Pandas vectorization vs loops I was able to cut the runtime down to less than 30 seconds. That is what I call value added. Thank you!  
I have also since made quite good use of Pandas for a few other scripts dealing with hydrology-related timeseries and can’t imagine not having taken the course and having to fumble my way through learning it piecemeal. Thank you again for delivering high value, real-world skills content in an inclusive, innovative learning environment."*

*"This course introduced me to so many valuable tools and techniques for working with geospatial data that I’ve continued to use. I regularly go back to the course material on GitHub and my old homework assignments for reference, and the final project I did for this class became the foundation for what will become part of my dissertation. The real-world examples presented in the class help to ground some of the complex or abstract methods in practical applications.*  
*David’s enthusiasm for exploring science and engineering questions with the latest open-source software tools comes through in his teaching, and the classroom environment was collaborative and fun! I’d recommend this course for anyone working with geospatial data, especially in the Earth and environmental sciences, and anyone interested in Python and open-source software."*
