## Large datasets

## General
* Students benefited from ~15-30 minutes at the beginning of lab to discuss code, answers, issues and questions. Useful before diving into new material. Lots of discussion when I wasn't present, often hard to get them to stop when the time came :). It was critical that they had already attempted to work through the exercises independently (or with recent Slack discussions).
